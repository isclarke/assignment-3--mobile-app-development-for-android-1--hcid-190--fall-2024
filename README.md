# Fall 2024 Mobile App Development for Android I — Assignment 3

* **Read these instructions repeatedly until you understand, then begin your project. If something is not clear, ask.**

## ❖ Before You Begin ❖

1. Log in to GitHub.
2. Fork this repo(sitory). See [this video](http://code-warrior.github.io/tutorials/git/github/forking-and-cloning-at-the-github-web-site/). **Ensure you check the box that asks if you *only* want to copy the `master` branch**.
3. Launch your command line interface, or CLI.
4. Use `gh` to clone your repo: `gh repo clone USERNAME/REPO-NAME`, where `USERNAME` is *your* GitHub username, not mine, and `REPO-NAME` is the name of this repo.
5. Create a branch with your first name and last name, all lower case and separated by a dash (no spaces). For example, my branch would be called `roy-vanegas` and I’d create it as follows: `git checkout -b roy-vanegas`. For there to be an upstream branch, I’d then do, `git push --set-upstream origin roy-vanegas`.
6. Checkout our your new personalized branch. In my case, I’d do it as such: `git checkout roy-vanegas`.
7. Do all your work in your personalized branch.

## ❖ Assignment Description ❖

For this assignment, you’ll implement the diamond program from assignment 1 as an Android app in Android Studio, exactly like how you did for the matrix program from assignment 1 for assignment 2. As a refresher, the diamond program accepts input from the user in the form of an integer, then creates a diamond whose width (in columns) and height (in rows) are dictated by user input. For example, if the user enters 5, then the height of the diamond is 5 rows and the width of the diamond is 5 columns.

**Watch [this video](http://vanegas.cs.hartford.edu/uploads/videos/diamond-program-in-java.mp4)**. **Note**: Odd and even versions of the diamond are rendered differently. Review the aforementioned video carefully for an example.

**Note**: The last assignment builds on this assignment, and this assignment builds on the first two.
